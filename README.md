This project focuses on building the security features needed for such a system to be trustworthy. It would ensure the money goes where it's supposed to, by preventing hacking, monitoring for errors, and making sure the communication between the smart contract and the landlord's server is encrypted. 

## About
This project tackles how to make automated rent payments (or other financial transactions) in a secure and reliable way using smart contracts. Imagine a system where a smart contract (a self-executing agreement) automatically sends rent from your account to your landlord's server every month, without needing manual intervention. This project focuses on building the security features needed for such a system to be trustworthy. It would ensure the money goes where it's supposed to, by preventing hacking, monitoring for errors, and making sure the communication between the smart contract and the landlord's server is encrypted. Overall, the project aims to create a smooth and secure way to handle automated payments in the exciting world of decentralized finance.

## Features
 * Secure Smart Contract Development
 * Encrypted Communication Channels
 * Transaction Monitoring Framework
 * Secure Tenant Server Integration

## Requirements
* Operating System: While development can be done on various OSes, a Linux or macOS.
* Development Environment: Python 3.8 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.

Detection Accuracy: 96.7%
Note: These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.


## Results and ImpactEnhanced Security: 
The project will establish robust security measures to mitigate threats like oracle manipulation, code vulnerabilities, and insecure communication. This will foster trust and confidence in the system.
Reduced Costs: By eliminating intermediary fees, both riders and drivers could benefit. Riders might experience lower fares, while drivers could see a larger share of the earnings.



This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.

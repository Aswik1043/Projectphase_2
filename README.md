This project focuses on building the security features needed for such a system to be trustworthy. It would ensure the money goes where it's supposed to, by preventing hacking, monitoring for errors, and making sure the communication between the smart contract and the landlord's server is encrypted. 

## About
This project tackles how to make automated rent payments (or other financial transactions) in a secure and reliable way using smart contracts. Imagine a system where a smart contract (a self-executing agreement) automatically sends rent from your account to your landlord's server every month, without needing manual intervention. This project focuses on building the security features needed for such a system to be trustworthy. It would ensure the money goes where it's supposed to, by preventing hacking, monitoring for errors, and making sure the communication between the smart contract and the landlord's server is encrypted. Overall, the project aims to create a smooth and secure way to handle automated payments in the exciting world of decentralized finance.

## Features
 * Secure Smart Contract Development
 * Encrypted Communication Channels
 * Transaction Monitoring Framework

## Requirements
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.
